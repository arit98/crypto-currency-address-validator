# Cryptocurrency Address Validator

## Overview
This project focuses on validating cryptocurrency addresses, specifically for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and TRON (TRX). The validation is performed using both Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Naive Bayes Classifier. The accuracy achieved by both models is 86%.

## Data Collection
The dataset used for training and testing the models comprises two types of data:
- **Generated Data**: Some data points are generated using algorithms.
- **Scraped Data**: Other data points are collected by scraping cryptocurrency address information from the web.

## Models Used
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of independence between features.

## Accuracy
Both SVC and Naive Bayes models achieved an accuracy rate of 86% in validating cryptocurrency addresses.

## Future Work
- Explore additional models to improve accuracy.
- Enhance the dataset with more diverse and accurate data sources.
- Implement real-time validation features for cryptocurrency addresses.
